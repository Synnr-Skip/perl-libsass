These scripts can be used to compile a dll that is compatible to the
used perl version. But you will need a fully working msys env with
autotools running correctly to be able to execute configure and make
for libsass directly. Since I do not use this regularly you need to
copy the files (bin, include and lib folder) to perl (c folder).
